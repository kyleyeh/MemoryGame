# MemoryGame

We're going to design and write a game to test a player's memory!

Through this, we will see how to incorporate various aspects of the Create Task requirements.

The Game  
At its core, this will be a simple memory game.  We will flash a certain number of words up on the screen and then the user will be asked to type them back once they all disappear.

What will we incorporate?   
Lists, procedures, parameters, iteration, selectionâ€¦the whole nine yards

How will we write this program?   
One step at a time!  Think about the core functionality first.

	1. Figure out how to pick random items from a list.
		a. Put those selected items into another list and return it from a method
	2. Figure out how to show words one at a time on the screen but then make them disappear when we want them to be gone.
	3. Make sure we know how to compare what a user types to a specific entry in the list and see if they got it right.
	4. Put it all together in a game format!
	5. (Maybe add options and variety?  Difficulty levels?  Differently-themed words?)
